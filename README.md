# PROJECT GOAL

#### The Requirement of a Business Problem is to develop a predictive model to Analyse and to Predict the WorkForce Analytics of Private Organization to improve the company's performance using Classification Analysis with Python.
#### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, evaluation has been implemented.

# Project Motivation

**The insights collected by data & analytics goes further than just tracking performance and evaluating motivation, he says. â€œIt can be used to identify and forecast a low performing employee. The data can be analysed to identify patterns and a plan can be implemented to improve performance**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
